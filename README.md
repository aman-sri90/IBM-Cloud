Problem Statement:
You have recently joined an Asset Management Firm as an Associate Analyst. One of the clients of your firm are keenly intersted in Amazon, Dominoâ€™s, Netflix and Bitcoin as an asset. But the financial markets are highly volatile and complex, making accurate prediction of stock prices and cryptocurrency values a challenging task. So, you have been tasked to develop a predictive model for forecasting the stock market values of Amazon (AMZ), Domino's Pizza Inc (DPZ), Netflix (NFLX), and the value of Bitcoin (BTC) using historical data. The primary objective is to explore and analyze the historical data to identify patterns and trends that can be leveraged to predict future prices. The secondary objective is to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms in predicting stock and cryptocurrency values and to determine which model provides the most accurate forecasts. By addressing these challenges, your firm aims to provide valuable insights and tools for their clients to make informed decisions in the stock and cryptocurrency markets. The outcome of this task could potentially enhance investment strategies and improve financial decision-making processes.
